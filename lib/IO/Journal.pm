=head1 NAME

IO::Journal - Perl interface for journalled file operations

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.2 ($Id$)

use version; our $VERSION = qv('0.2');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To ensure reliability, some file systems and databases provide support for
something known as journalling. The idea is to ensure data consistency by
creating a log of actions to be taken (called a Write Ahead Log) before
committing them to disk. That way, if a transaction were to fail, the
write ahead log could be used to finish writing the data.

While this functionality is often available with full-fledged databases,
often it is not completely necessary, yet reliability can be desirable.
Other times, the filesystem does not provide support for journalling,
but it can still be desirable. Thankfully, Alberto Bertogli published a
userspace C library called libjio that can provide these features in a
small (less than 1500 lines of code) library with no external dependencies.

This package has been published as a stub for the actual module and as
a bit of a land grab. Expect a working version in a few weeks.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use IO::Journal;

  # This is my current idea of what the interface will look like. It
  # may change prior to the actual release.
  my $file = IO::Journal->new('filename.txt');
  $file->print('...');
  # or
  print $file ('...');
  $file->commit;

# This is the code that actually bootstraps the module and exposes
# the interface for the user. XSLoader is believed to be more
# memory efficient than DynaLoader.
use XSLoader;
XSLoader::load(__PACKAGE__, $VERSION);

sub new {
  Carp::croak('This package does not have a ->new method. Use open or ' .
    'sysopen instead.');
  return;
}

# In order to mimic the Perl open function, we must map the following Perl
# flags to their fopen counterparts:
#
# Perl   C   Flags
#   <    r   O_RDONLY
#  +<    r+  O_RDWR
#   >    w   O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC
#  +>    w+  O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC
#  >>    a   O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_APPEND
# +>>    a+  O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_APPEND
#
# The Fcntl core module provides these constants.
my %FLAGMAP = (
  # Mode   Unix-style flags
  '<'   => O_RDONLY,
  '+<'  => O_RDWR,
  '>>'  => O_RDWR | O_CREAT,
  '+>>' => O_RDWR | O_CREAT,
  '>'   => O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC,
  '+>'  => O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC,
);

sub open {
  my ($self, $mode, $filename) = @_;

  Carp::croak('Unrecognized mode: ' . $mode)
    unless exists($FLAGMAP{$mode});

  return $self->sysopen($filename, $FLAGMAP{$mode});
}

sub begin_transaction {
  my ($self) = @_;

  return IO::Journal::Transaction->new($self);
}

=head1 CAVEATS

I have never developed an IO:: type module before this one, so I'm not
completely aware of the interfaces yet. I hope to make it compatible with
conventional interfaces like IO::Handle, but I might make a mistake.

There are no known bugs as of this release.
