=head1 NAME

IO::Journal - Perl module providing durable transaction-oriented I/O

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.3 ($Id$)

=cut

use version; our $VERSION = qv('0.3');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To ensure reliability, some file systems and databases provide support for
something known as journalling. The idea is to ensure data consistency by
creating a log of actions to be taken (called a Write Ahead Log) before
committing them to disk. That way, if a transaction were to fail due to a
system crash or other unexpected event, the write ahead log could be used
to finish writing the data.

While this functionality is often available with networked databases, it can
be a rather memory- and processor-intensive solution, even where reliable
writes are important. In other cases, the filesystem does not provide native
journalling support, so other tricks may be used to ensure data integrity,
such as writing to a separate temporary file and then overwriting the file
instead of modifying it in-place. Unfortunately, this method cannot handle
threaded operations appropriately.

Thankfully, Alberto Bertogli published a userspace C library called libjio
that can provide these features in a small (less than 1500 lines of code)
library with no external dependencies.

=head1 NOTICE

This module is currently a B<preview release>. Please, please, PLEASE don't
use it for production use yet, until all the kinks have been found and
sorted out.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use IO::Journal;

  my $journal = IO::Journal->open('>', 'filename.txt');

  # Start a new transaction
  my $trans = $journal->begin_transaction();
  $trans->syswrite("Hello");
  $trans->syswrite("World\n");
  $trans->commit;
  # File now contains "Hello World\n"

  $trans->rollback;
  # File is now blank

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. It provides
some convenience methods similar to C<IO::Handle>, but most of the work is
based on libjio, which may be installed automatically during this module's
build process through C<Alien::Libjio>.

If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture, please
contact the maintainer.

#  >>    a   O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_APPEND
# +>>    a+  O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_APPEND
#
# The Fcntl core module provides these constants.
my %FLAGMAP = (
  # Mode   Unix-style flags
  '<'   => O_RDONLY,
  '+<'  => O_RDWR,
  '>'   => O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC,
  '+>'  => O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC,
  '>>'  => O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_APPEND,
  '+>>' => O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_APPEND,
);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 IO::Journal->open( $mode, $filename )

Creates a C<IO::Journal> object on top of libjio's file handle system (an
opaque C<jfs_t> struct). This method opens the given file referenced by
C<filename> using the given Perl-like C<mode> string, which behaves similarly
to Perl's standard C<open> function.

Note that, unlike Perl's open, this method does not support the one-parameter
variant where a mode and filename are specified in the same string.

Example code:

  my $journal = IO::Journal->open('>>', 'filename');

This method will return an appropriate B<IO::Journal::Transaction> object
or throw an exception on error.

=cut

sub open {
  my ($class, $mode, $filename) = @_;

  Carp::croak('You must call this as a class method') if ref($class);

  Carp::croak('Unrecognized mode: ' . $mode) unless exists($FLAGMAP{$mode});

  return $class->sysopen($filename, $FLAGMAP{$mode});
}

=head2 $journal->begin_transaction()

This method starts a new transaction, which is essentially the same as
libjio's C<jtrans_new> function. In order to understand how to work with
transactions, you'll need to look at L<IO::Journal::Transaction>.

For now, this is really just a nicer way of constructing a new Transaction
object, similar in nature to:

  my $trans = IO::Journal::Transaction->new($journal);
  # looks messier & is longer to type than
  my $trans = $journal->begin_transaction();

It returns a newly created B<IO::Journal::Transaction> object, or throws
an exception on error.

=cut

sub begin_transaction {
  my ($self) = @_;

  Carp::croak('You must call this as an object method') unless ref($self);

  return IO::Journal::Transaction->new($self);
}

=head2 IO::Journal->sysopen( $filename, $mode, [ $permissions ] )

This function is the same as open, but is instead closer to the usual Unix
system call, requiring a set of octal flags (those provided by F<fcntl.h>
and exposed to Perl in L<Fcntl>).

As a result, it's much less convenient than using C<open> and doesn't have
as much error checking either, since it's implemented completely in XS.

One useful feature of sysopen is that it optionally supports giving an octal
specification of permissions to use in case the file doesn't yet exist. By
default, new files are created with the permissions B<0666> (rw-rw-rw-) but
the actual file created will vary based on your running C<umask>.

=head1 CAVEATS

I have never developed an IO:: type module before this one, so I'm not
completely aware of the interfaces yet. I hope to make it compatible with
conventional interfaces like IO::Handle, but I might make a mistake.

=head2 KNOWN BUGS

There are no known bugs as of this release.

In a perfect world, I could just say that this package and all of the code
it contains is Public Domain. It's a bit more complicated than that; you'll
