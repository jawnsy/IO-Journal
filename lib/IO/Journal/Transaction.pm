=head1 NAME

IO::Journal::Transaction - Perl interface to IO::Journal transactions

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.3 ($Id$)

use version; our $VERSION = qv('0.3');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the facilities for handling C<IO::Journal> transactions.
Operations can be added to the transaction object via the exposed interface;
they can then be either saved to file (commit) or simply discarded (rollback).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $trans = $journal->begin_transaction();
  $trans->write("Hello ");
  $trans->write("World\n");
  $trans->commit(); # may die
  # File either contains "Hello World\n" or nothing

  # Transactions can be rolled back even after committing! (But only if we
  # have a current handle to the transaction)
  $trans->rollback();

=cut

# This is the code that actually bootstraps the module and exposes
# the interface for the user. XSLoader is believed to be more
# memory efficient than DynaLoader.
use XSLoader;
XSLoader::load(__PACKAGE__, $VERSION);
